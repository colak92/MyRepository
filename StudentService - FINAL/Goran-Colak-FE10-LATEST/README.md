# Angular 14 student service project: CRUD with Rest API

Build an Angular 14 CRUD App example to consume Rest APIs, create, display, modify, delete & search data.

Student Service Application in that:
1. Each Student has:
 - id 
 - index number
 - index year 
 - first name
 - last name 
 - email
 - address
 - postal code
 - current year of study

2. We can create, retrieve, update, delete Students.
3. There is a Search bar for finding Students by index number.

Run `ng serve --port 4200` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
